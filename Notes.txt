Namespaces: 
-->Namespaces are used in c# to organize and provide a level of seperation of code.
-->namespace is considered as a container which consists of namespaces, classes, interface, deligates and structures.
-->Example: In a real life scenario we have a large number of files and folders in our computer. 
Imagine how difficult it would be to manage them if they are placed in a single directory.
-->The concept of the namespace is similar in c# to organize different members by keeping related members in the same namespace.
 We can solve the problem of naming conflict.
